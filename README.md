Show a mini cart when hovered over the cart icon. Here is a working example: http://vanstore.myshopify.com/?preview_theme_id=157363075

This is implemented using templating from underscore.js & jquery so make sure these libraries are installed on theme.

1. Mini-cart template snippet

2. Javascript for mini-cart

Add template snippet and javascript on theme.liquid

3. CSS for styling (edit styling as per requirements)
